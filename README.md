# Environment Setting

I am using google cloud in this project, you will get 300 us dollar credit vaild for one year when you sign-up. 

1. create a project
2. create a VM instance under compute engine, select machine based on your budge, it seems there is option to deploy a docker image directly to this VM, hopefully I can do that after the study.

system CentOS7 (since my work place has rhel, if I have time I will try the same on Ubuntu as well)
Disk 200GB
8 vCPUs
52 GB memory

$250.01 per month (Don't forget to shut down)

For the connection setting, I am using the default one, will look into it if has the time.
